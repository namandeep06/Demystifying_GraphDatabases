# Demystifying_GraphDatabases
Advanced Database Concepts Summer Project
The healthcare sector faces significant challenges in managing complex, interconnected clinical data using traditional Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS). This work, investigates the performance benefits of transitioning to graph databases, specifically using TigerGraph, for enhanced data handling and query efficiency. By implementing and comparing a clinical dataset in both TigerGraph and SQL, a comprehensive evaluation of query performance, data integration, and scalability is provided. The findings indicate that while graph databases offer substantial improvements in managing interconnected data, they also present specific limitations and challenges. The study suggests that while SQL databases are suitable for fast query execution in structured environments, TigerGraph is invaluable for applications requiring advanced visualization and relationship data management.
